## data-structures

### Part 1
Implemented stacks and queues using all different intantiation patters: functional, functional-shared, prototypal, and pseudo-classical.

### Part 2

Built data structures so they passed specs.  

Completed the following first with a partner and later on my own:
  - set
  - hash table
  - linked list
  - tree
  - binary search tree
  - graph
